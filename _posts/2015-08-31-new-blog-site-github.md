Finally I gave another try to revitalize my blogs. I tried it several times mostly by swithing from a blog service to another. None of them lasted long for various reasons. This time I chose a static site generator for maximum control and more geekish style. Then Github appears to be an obvious choice of hosting.

I don't plan to migrate my old posts. Let them die. I might reuse some of the topics but with new content, that is, something with more value to me and to others.

Let's see what it turns out to be this time.
